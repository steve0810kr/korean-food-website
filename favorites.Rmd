# My Favorite Korean Foods ❤️🇰🇷  

Below are three of my personal favorite Korean dishes — warm, comforting, and full of deep flavor.

Served in a sizzling stone pot, this version of bibimbap creates a delicious crispy rice layer at the bottom called **nurungji**.  
Mixed with gochujang, vegetables, and a fried egg — pure happiness!

## 🍲 Doenjang Jjigae (된장찌개)
